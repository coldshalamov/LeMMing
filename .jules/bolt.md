# Bolt's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - [Project Structure]
**Learning:** This project uses a file-based architecture for agent communication and state persistence.
**Action:** Focus backend optimizations on file I/O operations (e.g., `os.scandir` instead of `os.listdir` or reading files) and efficient JSON handling.

## 2024-05-23 - [EAFP for File I/O]
**Learning:** `Path.exists()` incurs an extra syscall. In this file-heavy architecture, using EAFP (try/except FileNotFoundError) for `load_memory` and `delete_memory` saves significant overhead. For `save_memory`, optimistic writing (assuming directory exists) with a fallback to `mkdir` handles the common case (updates) efficiently.
**Action:** Apply EAFP pattern to other file operations like `resume.json` or logs if they become bottlenecks.

## 2024-05-23 - [Redundant Syscalls in Hot Paths]
**Learning:** `mkdir(exist_ok=True)` is cheap but not free (~0.04ms). In hot paths like logging (called every tick/action), calling it repeatedly adds up.
**Action:** Move filesystem setup code inside initialization blocks (e.g., inside `if not logger.handlers:`) to ensure it runs only once per process.

## 2024-05-24 - [Optimistic Write for Messaging]
**Learning:** `write_outbox_entry` is a critical hot path (called for every message). Checking/creating the directory on every write added significant overhead (~50% of operation time).
**Action:** Applied the optimistic write pattern (try write -> catch FileNotFoundError -> mkdir -> retry) to `write_outbox_entry` and `FileWriteTool`. Benchmark showed ~2x speedup for writing messages.
