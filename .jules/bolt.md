## 2024-05-22 - [Project Structure]
**Learning:** This project uses a file-based architecture for agent communication and state persistence.
**Action:** Focus backend optimizations on file I/O operations (e.g., `os.scandir` instead of `os.listdir` or reading files) and efficient JSON handling.

## 2024-05-23 - [EAFP for File I/O]
**Learning:** `Path.exists()` incurs an extra syscall. In this file-heavy architecture, using EAFP (try/except FileNotFoundError) for `load_memory` and `delete_memory` saves significant overhead. For `save_memory`, optimistic writing (assuming directory exists) with a fallback to `mkdir` handles the common case (updates) efficiently.
**Action:** Apply EAFP pattern to other file operations like `resume.json` or logs if they become bottlenecks.
