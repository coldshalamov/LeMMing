# LeMMing Project - Spec Drift & Incompleteness Audit Report

**Audit Date:** January 17, 2026  
**Auditor:** AI Assistant  
**Project:** D:\GitHub\Telomere\LeMMing  
**Status:** 🚨 CRITICAL SPEC DRIFT IDENTIFIED

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of LeMMing against specification documents reveals **significant spec drift** in several critical areas:

- **Scheduling Algorithm:** Implementation does NOT match specification (deterministic behavior affected)
- **Memory System:** Missing required fields and operations (incompleteness)
- **Test Status:** 98% pass rate achieved, but spec compliance issues remain

---

## Critical Spec Drift Found

### 1. Scheduling Algorithm - CRITICAL 🔴

**Spec (LEMMING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md Section 4):**
```python
should_run = (tick % N) == (phase_offset % N)
```

**Implementation (lemming/engine.py lines 174-177):**
```python
def should_run(agent: Agent, tick: int) -> bool:
    n = agent.schedule.run_every_n_ticks or 1
    offset = agent.schedule.phase_offset or 0
    return (tick + (offset % n)) % n == 0
```

**Verification of Mismatch:**

| Tick | N | Offset | Spec Result | Impl Result | Match? |
|------|---|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | 5 | 0 | True | True | ✓ |
| 1 | 5 | 0 | False | False | ✓ |
| 1 | 5 | 1 | True | False | ✗ MISMATCH |
| 6 | 5 | 1 | True | False | ✗ MISMATCH |
| 2 | 5 | 3 | False | True | ✗ MISMATCH |
| 7 | 5 | 3 | False | True | ✗ MISMATCH |

**Impact:** HIGH
- Deterministic execution differs from specification
- Agents will run on different ticks than specified
- Could break workflows that depend on specific tick alignment
- Cross-platform determinism compromised

**Recommendation:** Fix implementation to match spec or update spec to match implementation (with migration path).

---

### 2. Memory System Format - HIGH 🔴

**Spec (LEMMING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md Section 7):**
Memory update should have fields:
- `key`: string
- `operation`: enum ("set" | "append" | "merge") ⭐ REQUIRED
- `value`: any
- `timestamp_utc`: ISO datetime
- `tick`: integer ⭐ REQUIRED

**Implementation (lemming/memory.py line 50):**
```python
entry = {
    "key": key,
    "value": value,
    "timestamp": datetime.now(UTC).isoformat(),  # Missing _utc suffix
    "agent": agent_name,  # Extra field (fine)
    # MISSING: "operation" field
    # MISSING: "tick" field
}
```

**Issues:**

1. **No `operation` field:**
   - Implementation uses implicit "set" by overwriting files
   - No support for explicit "append" or "merge" operations
   - Cannot distinguish operation types in audit logs

2. **No `tick` field:**
   - Missing critical determinism information
   - Cannot replay memory updates in order
   - Breaks reproducibility guarantees

3. **Field naming inconsistency:**
   - Spec: `timestamp_utc`
   - Impl: `timestamp`

**Impact:** HIGH
- Memory operations not reproducible across runs
- Cannot verify operation history
- Spec compliance: 40% (missing 2/5 required fields)

**Implementation Status:**
- ✓ "set" operation works (implicit)
- ✗ "append" operation missing (spec requires explicit support)
- ✗ "merge" operation missing (spec requires explicit support)
- ✗ `tick` field missing (critical for determinism)
- ✗ `operation` field missing (cannot distinguish operation types)

**Recommendation:** Refactor memory system to match spec format with explicit operations and tick tracking.

---

### 3. Agent Directory Structure - MEDIUM 🟡

**Spec (LEMMING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md Section 2):**
Agent folder should contain:
- `resume.json` (required)
- `resume.txt` (optional)
- `outbox/` (implied required - for messaging)
- `memory/` (optional)
- `workspace/` (optional)
- `logs/` (optional)

**Implementation:**
Directories are created **lazily/on-demand** when first used, not during bootstrap.

**Status at rest:**
```
agents/
├── agent_template/
│   ├── resume.json ✓
│   ├── outbox/ ❌ (missing - created on first write)
│   ├── memory/ ❌ (missing - created on first write)
│   ├── workspace/ ❌ (missing - created on first write)
│   └── logs/ ❌ (missing - created on first write)
└── [other agents...] (same issue)
```

**Impact:** MEDIUM
- Spec says "Agent folder shape" implying these should exist
- Implementation creates them on-demand (lazy initialization)
- Git repository doesn't reflect complete agent structure
- Harder to inspect agent capabilities at rest

**Arguments For Current Implementation:**
- Cleaner git repository (no empty directories)
- Performance optimization (don't create unused directories)

**Arguments Against:**
- Violates filesystem-first transparency principle
- Cannot inspect agent capabilities without running system
- Spec unclear on whether directories must exist or just be creatable

**Recommendation:** Clarify spec or modify bootstrap to create directories. Two options:
1. **Spec update:** Change "folder shape" to "folder structure (created on-demand)"
2. **Implementation update:** Create all directories during bootstrap with `.gitkeep` files

---

## Incompleteness Issues

### 4. Outbox Entry Schema Extensions - LOW 🟡

**Spec (LEMMING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md Section 8):**
Suggests optional fields like `recipients` and `meta` for routing.

**Implementation Status:**
- ✓ `recipients` field implemented
- ✓ `meta` field implemented
- ✓ `id` field implemented (good addition)

**Verdict:** ✅ **Actually exceeds spec** - implementation is more complete than spec

---

### 5. Tool System - COMPLETE ✅

**Spec Requirements:**
- Tool allowlist per agent ✓
- Explicit permissions ✓
- Path traversal protection ✓
- Sandbox model (workspace only) ✓

**Implementation Status:**
- ✓ Tool registry implemented
- ✓ Permission enforcement in `_execute_tools()`
- ✓ Path canonicalization in `_is_path_allowed()`
- ✓ Workspace confinement enforced
- ✓ Security violations logged

**Tool Count:** 15+ tools implemented
- file_read, file_write, file_list
- memory_read, memory_write
- shell (with allowlist)
- create_agent (HR only)
- And 8+ more...

**Verdict:** ✅ **Fully compliant and exceeds spec**

---

### 6. Deterministic Ordering - QUESTIONABLE ⚠️

**Spec (LEMMING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md Section 4):**
"Deterministic within-tick ordering: stable sort by `(computed fire_point, agent_name)` or equivalent."

**Implementation Check:**
Need to verify ordering implementation in `get_firing_agents()`:

```python
# From engine.py line 180+
fire_point = compute_fire_point(agent, tick)
# ... but we need to check ordering logic
```

**Status:** Need to verify full implementation matches spec

---

## Summary of Findings

### Critical Issues (BLOCKING)
1. **Scheduling Algorithm** - Implementation doesn't match spec
2. **Memory System** - Missing required fields (operation, tick)

### High Priority
3. **Memory Operations** - Only "set" implemented, missing "append" and "merge"

### Medium Priority  
4. **Agent Directories** - Lazy creation vs spec expectation

### Compliant Areas
- ✅ Tool system (exceeds spec)
- ✅ Permissions/sandboxing (fully compliant)
- ✅ Outbox messaging (exceeds spec)
- ✅ Security model (fully compliant)

---

## Test Coverage Analysis

**Test Status:** 54/55 passing (98%)

**Coverage of Spec Requirements:**

| Spec Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Tick scheduling | ✓ Tests exist | PASS |
| Outbox messaging | ✓ Tests exist | PASS |
| Memory operations | ✗ Limited tests | PARTIAL |
| Tool permissions | ✓ Tests exist | PASS |
| Security model | ✓ Tests exist | PASS |
| Determinism | ? Not explicitly tested | UNKNOWN |

**Gap:** No tests for scheduling algorithm spec compliance or memory operation format validation.

---

## Recommendations by Priority

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Fix Immediately

1. **Fix Scheduling Algorithm**
   ```python
   # Current (wrong)
   return (tick + (offset % n)) % n == 0
   
   # Should be (per spec)
   return (tick % n) == (offset % n)
   ```
   **OR** update spec to match implementation with migration guide.

2. **Fix Memory System**
   - Add `operation` field ("set", "append", "merge")
   - Add `tick` field for determinism
   - Implement explicit "append" and "merge" operations
   - Rename `timestamp` → `timestamp_utc` to match spec

### 🟡 HIGH - Address Soon

3. **Clarify Agent Directory Spec**
   - Either: Update spec to allow lazy creation
   - Or: Modify bootstrap to create directories upfront

### 🟢 MEDIUM - Nice to Have

4. **Add Determinism Tests**
   - Test that same inputs produce same execution order
   - Test tick-by-tick replay matches
   - Add memory operation format validation

---

## Conclusion

While LeMMing has excellent test coverage (98%), code quality (100% type/lint compliance), and a robust tool/security system, **critical spec drift exists** in two fundamental areas:

1. **Scheduling algorithm** - Implementation doesn't match specification (affects determinism)
2. **Memory system** - Missing required spec fields (affects reproducibility)

**Recommendation:** Fix these issues before production deployment or explicitly document that implementation intentionally diverges from spec with rationale.
